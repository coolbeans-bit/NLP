# NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. The core objective of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding.

Key NLP Concepts & Experiments
Text Preprocessing

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or sentences.

Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words like "the," "is," "and."

Stemming & Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run").

Bag of Words (BoW) Model

Converts text into numerical form by counting word occurrences.

Used for text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

Assigns weights to words based on their importance in a document relative to a corpus.

Helps in keyword extraction and information retrieval.

Zipf’s Law in NLP

Observes that a few words appear frequently, while most are rare.

Helps in understanding word distributions and optimizing NLP models.

Sentiment Analysis

Classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral using NLP techniques.

Used in product reviews, social media analysis, and brand monitoring.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Identifies entities like names, locations, and dates in text.

Useful in chatbots, search engines, and information extraction.

Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)

Converts words into dense vector representations capturing meaning and context.

Enhances NLP applications like chatbots and language translation.
